# ansible-openvpn
A simple fail2ban role that gets your server starting in a jiffy.

# How to use
1. Edit `hosts` to include your server (instead of mine).
2. Edit `site.yml` if you want to include other roles
3. Edit `./fail2ban/templates/jail.local` if you want to change your local fail2ban config. This one usually works for me.
4. `./run.sh`
